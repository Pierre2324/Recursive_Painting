0s being a color (ex: white)
1s being another color (ex: light gray)

User has to input a point(x,y) of the array. 
Program has to paint (represented with 2s) the array cell and its next neighbors (up, down, left, right),
the 2nd next neighbors, etc until every neighbors have been painted.


PROJECTS:
2 C# projects have been made.
First in Windows Form app.
Second in terminal directly.

Grid is randomly generated.
Input are verified to make sure they aren't out of range or NaN (not a number).
